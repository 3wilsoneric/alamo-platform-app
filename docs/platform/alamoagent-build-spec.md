# AlamoAgent build spec — source ownership

- purpose: point to the independent agent engine's single living build spec
- status: current ownership map; extraction implemented locally, not deployed
- owners: product and engineering
- updated: 2026-10-16
- tags: alamoagent, engine, skills, connectors
- labels: platform-handbook, current-state

The canonical [AlamoAgent build spec](/Users/eric/CareEngineMain/alamoagent/docs/build-spec.md)
now lives with the independent engine at `/Users/eric/CareEngineMain/alamoagent`.
Read its [editing guide](/Users/eric/CareEngineMain/alamoagent/README.md) and
[application connector guide](/Users/eric/CareEngineMain/alamoagent/docs/connectors.md).
Update that spec in every relevant change; do not start a competing Platform plan.

The user prioritized building the agent and connecting many applications. The
standalone UI is parked. Engine source, skill definitions, workflows and connector
routing are edited in AlamoAgent. Platform consumes a pinned archive at
`vendor/alamo-agent-runtime-0.1.0.tgz`; the old engine modules re-export that package.
There are no sibling runtime imports or symlinks. Rebuild/bump the package and run
Platform integration checks before adopting another engine version.

Platform retains its [source API](../../server/platform-agent-source-api.mjs),
[source grant store](../../server/platform-agent-source-grants.mjs), domain adapters,
existing UI, and deployment records. Source permissions remain authoritative.
Both production skill definitions still read Platform projections; the Admissions
aggregate is not a direct Pipeline assessment integration. Multi-app routing is
verified with two synthetic authenticated HTTP applications.

Eric-only access and disabled emails remain unchanged. Andrew's Wilson branding
is saved, with no access enabled. Extraction and tests do not establish production
availability. See [deployment operations](deployment-operations.md) for receipts.
